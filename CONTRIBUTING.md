# Contributing

Hey! You've decided you want to start contributing to our repo. That's awesome! Thanks so much!

We ask that you follow [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) while contributing.

**TLDR** Here are the major points:  
* Anything in the master branch is deployable  
* To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (e.g. 'new-oauth2-scopes')  
* Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server  
* When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request  
* After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master  
* Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and should deploy immediately  

Here we emphasize committing often to **[WIP] Pull Requests**. These offer a place for quick feedback and conversation.
